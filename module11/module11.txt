1)Insertion Anomaly: Adding a new patient into the database requires that we add a visit date, as well as provider information and the diagnosis for that visit. This is extra information that most likely is not useful if we simply want to add a new patient into the database.

Update Anomaly: If we need to update the age of the patient, we will utilize extra resources because we need to update the age of the patient in all rows with the corresponding PatNo. In this table, if we need to increase the age of the patient with PatNo = 1, we need to update rows 1 and 2.

Deletion Anomaly: We may need to delete the records of the patient with PatNo = 1. To do this, we must delete the associated visits they had, as well as the diagnoses performed. This could be undesired if we still want to see which providers performed which diagnoses on which dates, regardless of the patients involved.


2)Steps of BCNF Normalization Process:

i) Group FDs with the same determinant (LHS)
   PatNo -> PatAge, PatZip 
   PatZip -> PatCity 
   VisitNo -> VisitDate, PatNo 
   ProvNo -> ProvSpecialty, ProvEmail 
   VisitNo, ProvNo -> Diagnosis 
   ProvEmail -> ProvNo

ii) Create Tables using Determinant as primary key, adding foreign keys where necessary
    Patient(PatNo, PatAge, PatZip) FOREIGN KEY (PatZip) REFERENCES Zip
    Zip(PatZip, PatCity)
    Visit(VisitNo, VisitDate, PatNo) FOREIGN KEY (PatNo) REFERENCES Patient
    Provider(ProvNo, ProvSpecialty, ProvEmail) FOREIGN KEY (ProvEmail) REFERENCES ProviderEmail
    Appointment(VisitNo, ProvNo, Diagnosis) FOREIGN KEY (VisitNo) REFERENCES Visit FOREIGN KEY (ProvNo) REFERENCES Provider
    ProviderEmail(ProvEmail, ProvNo) FOREIGN KEY (ProvNo) REFERENCES Provider

iii) Merge tables if one contains columns that are a subset of another table
     Through this process we can only remove the ProviderEmail table. We can also remove the foreign key constraints on the other table definitions that reference these tables, as well as add additional UNIQUE constraints as required, resulting in our normalized list of final tables:
     Patient(PatNo, PatAge, PatZip) FOREIGN KEY (PatZip) REFERENCES Zip
     Zip(PatZip, PatCity)
     Visit(VisitNo, VisitDate, PatNo) FOREIGN KEY (PatNo) REFERENCES Patient
     Provider(ProvNo, ProvSpecialty, ProvEmail) UNIQUE ProviderEmail
     Appointment(VisitNo, ProvNo, Diagnosis) FOREIGN KEY (VisitNo) REFERENCES Visit FOREIGN KEY (ProvNo) REFERENCES Provider


3)
    1.) Table Name - Lender
    Primary Key - LenderNo
    Columns - LenderNo, LenderName(Unique)
    2.) Table Name - Institution
    Primary Key - InstNo
    Columns - InstNo, InstName(Unique), InstMascot
    3.) Table Name - Student
    Primary Key - StdNo
    Columns - StdNo, StdName, StdEmail(Unique), StdAddress, StdCity, StdState, StdZip

    The following tables are in BCNF


4)
	1.) OrdNo -> ItemNo
	This FD falsifies due to rows (1,2) and (3,4)
	2.) OrdNo -> QtyOrd
	This FD falsifies due to rows (3,4)
	3.) OrdNo -> CustNo
	This FD is valid
	4.) OrdNo -> CustBal
	This FD is valid
	5.) OrdNo -> CustDisc
	This FD is valid
	6.) OrdNo -> ItemPrice
	This FD falsifies due to rows (1,2) and (3,4)
	7.) OrdNo -> OrdDate
	This FD is valid
